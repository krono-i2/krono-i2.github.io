abstract: In multiple antenna systems employing time-division duplexing, spatial precoder
  design at the base station (BS) leverages channel state information acquired through
  uplink pilot transmission, under the assumption of channel reciprocity. Malicious
  eavesdroppers can start pilot spoofing attacks to alter such design, in order to
  improve their eavesdropping performance in downlink. The aim of this paper is to
  study the effects of pilot spoofing attacks on uplink channel estimation, by assuming
  that the BS knows the angle of arrivals (AoAs) of the legitimate channels. Specifically,
  after assessing the performance of the simple least squares estimator (LSE), we
  consider more sophisticated estimators, such as the maximum likelihood estimator
  (MLE) and different versions of the minimum mean square error estimator (MMSEE),
  involving different degrees of a priori information about the pilot spoofing attacks.
  Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are used to compare the performance
  of such estimators. In particular, we analytically demonstrate that the spoofing
  effects in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime can be completely suppressed, under
  certain conditions involving the AoAs of the legitimate and spoofing channels. Moreover,
  we show that even an imperfect knowledge of the AoAs and of the average transmission
  power of the spoofing signals allows the MLE and MMSEE to achieve significant performance
  gains over the LSE.
