abstract: The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or \"drones\" into the
  civil aviation airspace is a problem of increasing interest in the aviation community,
  as testified by manyinitiatives developed worldwide. Many traditional surveillance
  solutions for manned aircrafts employ the Automatic Dependent System-Broadcast (ADS-B)
  technology, which however might present several problems when used for UAVs, especially
  smaller ones and/or those flying at very low altitudes. We present in this paper
  a cloud-based surveillance solution for UAVs, which can be considered as an enhancement
  of a conventional ADS-B system. The proposed solution leverages inexpensive onboard
  transceivers for transmitting positional messages from the UAVs to the ground. A
  network of ADS-B gateways based on the software-defined radio (SDR) paradigm, after
  formatting the positional messages into valid ADS-B signals, rebroadcasts them in
  the air, which allows one to emulate a true ADS-B system, overcoming some disadvantages
  of a conventional implementation. A first physical layer laboratory implementation
  of the proposed solution is presented, based on off-the-shelf SDR hardware, which
  is programmed using the open-source GNU Radio environment.
