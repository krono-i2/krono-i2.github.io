abstract: Networks whereby traditional terrestrial users (TUs) coexist with flying
  unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) acting as additional aerial users (AUs), has gained
  significant attention as a promising technology for future 5G and beyond networks.
  In this scenario, we investigate the case wherein an UAV and a static TU are paired
  to simultaneously transmit their uplink signals to a ground base station (BS) in
  the same time-frequency resource blocks. The signal transmitted by the AU experiences
  both time dispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion
  caused by Doppler shifts, whereas the signal transmitted by the static TU is subject
  to multipath effects. To decode the superposed signals at the BS, we propose a novel
  sky-ground (SG) nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) receiving structure that additionally
  exploits the different circularity/noncircularity and almost-cyclostationarity properties
  of the AU and TU through time-varying successive interference cancellation.
