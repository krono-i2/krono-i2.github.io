abstract: While the combination of multi-antenna and relaying techniques has been
  extensively studied for Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) and Internet of Things
  (IoT) applications, it is expected to still play an important role in 5th Generation
  (5G) networks. However, the expected benefits of these technologies cannot be achieved
  without a proper system design. In this paper, we consider the problem of jointly
  optimizing terminal precoders/decoders and relay forwarding matrices on the basis
  of the sum mean square error (MSE) criterion in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
  two-way relay systems, where two multi-antenna nodes mutually exchange information
  via multi-antenna amplify-and-forward relays. This problem is nonconvex and a local
  optimal solution is typically found by using iterative algorithms based on alternating
  optimization. We show how the constrained minimization of the sum-MSE can be relaxed
  to obtain two separated subproblems which, under mild conditions, admit a closed-form
  solution. Compared to iterative approaches, the proposed design is more suited to
  be integrated in 5G networks, since it is computationally more convenient and its
  performance exhibits a better scaling in the number of relays.
