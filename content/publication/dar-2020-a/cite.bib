 abstract = {While the combination of multi-antenna and relaying techniques has been extensively studied for Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, it is expected to still play an important role in 5th Generation (5G) networks. However, the expected benefits of these technologies cannot be achieved without a proper system design. In this paper, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing terminal precoders/decoders and relay forwarding matrices on the basis of the sum mean square error (MSE) criterion in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) two-way relay systems, where two multi-antenna nodes mutually exchange information via multi-antenna amplify-and-forward relays. This problem is nonconvex and a local optimal solution is typically found by using iterative algorithms based on alternating optimization. We show how the constrained minimization of the sum-MSE can be relaxed to obtain two separated subproblems which, under mild conditions, admit a closed-form solution. Compared to iterative approaches, the proposed design is more suited to be integrated in 5G networks, since it is computationally more convenient and its performance exhibits a better scaling in the number of relays.},
