abstract: Without the need for an on-board pilot, drones are designed to accomplish
  dull, dangerous and dirty missions. However, if a mission exhibits a large operative
  area and/or several objectives, it may entail poor performance when executed by
  a single drone. Drone teams may overcome this issue by acting as mobile sensor networks
  for proximal sensing. In such networks, cooperative autonomy is a key enabling behaviour
  for achieving resilient and cost-efficient systems. This work implements cooperative
  autonomous behaviour in the form of a dynamic and decentralized mission planner
  for a multi-drone inspection mission. The proposed design exploits multi-agent task
  allocation, distributed route planning and game theory for the assignment of inspection
  tasks and for the processing of optimal routes in reasonable time frames and with
  limited communication. In detail, it applies the learning-in-games framework for
  the coordination within the inspection team, by studying some ad-hoc variants of
  best response and of log linear learning. Moreover, this work presents some numerical
  results of model-in-the-loop tests for a comparison between the learning-in-games
  approaches.
