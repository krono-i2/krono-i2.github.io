abstract: 'Management of crowd information in public transportation (PT) systems is
  crucial, both to foster sustainable mobility, by increasing the userï¿½s comfort and
  satisfaction during normal operation, as well as to cope with emergency situations,
  such as pandemic crises, as recently experienced with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
  limitations. This article presents a taxonomy and review of sensing technologies
  based on the Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time crowd analysis, which can be
  adopted in the different segments of the PT system (buses/trams/trains, railway/metro
  stations, and bus/tram stops). To discuss such technologies in a clear systematic
  perspective, we introduce a reference architecture for crowd management, which employs
  modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) in order to: 1) monitor
  and predict crowding events; 2) implement crowd-aware policies for real-time and
  adaptive operation control in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs); and 3)
  inform in real time the users of the crowding status of the PT system, by means
  of electronic displays installed inside vehicles or at bus/tram stops/stations and/or
  by mobile transport applications. It is envisioned that the innovative crowd management
  functionalities enabled by ICT/IoT sensing technologies can be incrementally implemented
  as an add-on to state-of-the-art ITS platforms, which are already in use by major
  PT companies operating in urban areas. Moreover, it is argued that, in this new
  framework, additional services can be delivered to the passengers, such as online
  ticketing, vehicle access control and reservation in severely crowded situations,
  and evolved crowd-aware route planning.'
