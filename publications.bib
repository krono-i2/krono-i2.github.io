  abstract     = {In multiple antenna systems employing time-division duplexing, spatial precoder design at the base station (BS) leverages channel state information acquired through uplink pilot transmission, under the assumption of channel reciprocity. Malicious eavesdroppers can start pilot spoofing attacks to alter such design, in order to improve their eavesdropping performance in downlink. The aim of this paper is to study the effects of pilot spoofing attacks on uplink channel estimation, by assuming that the BS knows the angle of arrivals (AoAs) of the legitimate channels. Specifically, after assessing the performance of the simple least squares estimator (LSE), we consider more sophisticated estimators, such as the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and different versions of the minimum mean square error estimator (MMSEE), involving different degrees of a priori information about the pilot spoofing attacks. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are used to compare the performance of such estimators. In particular, we analytically demonstrate that the spoofing effects in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime can be completely suppressed, under certain conditions involving the AoAs of the legitimate and spoofing channels. Moreover, we show that even an imperfect knowledge of the AoAs and of the average transmission power of the spoofing signals allows the MLE and MMSEE to achieve significant performance gains over the LSE.},

Many traditional surveillance solutions for manned aircrafts employ the Automatic Dependent System-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology, which however might present several problems when used for UAVs, especially smaller ones and/or those flying at very low altitudes. We present in this paper a cloud-based surveillance solution for UAVs, which can be considered as an enhancement of a conventional ADS-B system. The proposed solution leverages inexpensive onboard transceivers for transmitting positional messages from the UAVs to the ground. A network of ADS-B gateways based on the software-defined radio (SDR) paradigm, after formatting the positional messages into valid ADS-B signals, rebroadcasts them in the air, which allows one to emulate a true ADS-B system, overcoming some disadvantages of a conventional implementation. A first physical layer laboratory implementation of the proposed solution is presented, based on off-the-shelf SDR hardware, which is programmed using the open-source GNU Radio environment.},

In this scenario, we investigate the case wherein an UAV and a static TU are paired to simultaneously transmit their uplink signals to a ground base station (BS) in the same time-frequency resource blocks. The signal transmitted by the AU experiences both time dispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion caused by Doppler shifts, whereas the signal transmitted by the static TU is subject to multipath effects. To decode the superposed signals at the BS, we propose a novel sky-ground (SG) nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) receiving structure that additionally exploits the different circularity/noncircularity and almost-cyclostationarity properties of the AU and TU through time-varying successive interference cancellation.},

This article presents a taxonomy and review of sensing technologies based on the Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time crowd analysis, which can be adopted in the different segments of the PT system (buses/trams/trains, railway/metro stations, and bus/tram stops). To discuss such technologies in a clear systematic perspective, we introduce a reference architecture for crowd management, which employs modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) in order to: 1) monitor and predict crowding events; 2) implement crowd-aware policies for real-time and adaptive operation control in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs); and 3) inform in real time the users of the crowding status of the PT system, by means of electronic displays installed inside vehicles or at bus/tram stops/stations and/or by mobile transport applications. It is envisioned that the innovative crowd management functionalities enabled by ICT/IoT sensing technologies can be incrementally implemented as an add-on to state-of-the-art ITS platforms, which are already in use by major PT companies operating in urban areas. Moreover, it is argued that, in this new framework, additional services can be delivered to the passengers, such as online ticketing, vehicle access control and reservation in severely crowded situations, and evolved crowd-aware route planning.},

  abstract       = {While the combination of multi-antenna and relaying techniques has been extensively studied for Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, it is expected to still play an important role in 5th Generation (5G) networks. However, the expected benefits of these technologies cannot be achieved without a proper system design. In this paper, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing terminal precoders/decoders and relay forwarding matrices on the basis of the sum mean square error (MSE) criterion in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) two-way relay systems, where two multi-antenna nodes mutually exchange information via multi-antenna amplify-and-forward relays. This problem is nonconvex and a local optimal solution is typically found by using iterative algorithms based on alternating optimization. We show how the constrained minimization of the sum-MSE can be relaxed to obtain two separated subproblems which, under mild conditions, admit a closed-form solution. Compared to iterative approaches, the proposed design is more suited to be integrated in 5G networks, since it is computationally more convenient and its performance exhibits a better scaling in the number of relays.},

  abstract  = {Without the need for an on-board pilot, drones are designed to accomplish dull, dangerous and dirty missions. However, if a mission exhibits a large operative area and/or several objectives, it may entail poor performance when executed by a single drone. Drone teams may overcome this issue by acting as mobile sensor networks for proximal sensing. In such networks, cooperative autonomy is a key enabling behaviour for achieving resilient and cost-efficient systems. This work implements cooperative autonomous behaviour in the form of a dynamic and decentralized mission planner for a multi-drone inspection mission. The proposed design exploits multi-agent task allocation, distributed route planning and game theory for the assignment of inspection tasks and for the processing of optimal routes in reasonable time frames and with limited communication. In detail, it applies the learning-in-games framework for the coordination within the inspection team, by studying some ad-hoc variants of best response and of log linear learning. Moreover, this work presents some numerical results of model-in-the-loop tests for a comparison between the learning-in-games approaches.},

  abstract        = {Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) have recently emerged as a novel technology that enables the implementation of signal-processing algorithms in the electromagnetic wave domain. However, existing works employing SIM in wireless scenarios rely solely on nearly passive structures that control only the phase of the meta-atoms in each layer. We propose a SIM-aided downlink multiuser transmission scheme, where the SIM at the base station (BS) is designed by combining nearly passive layers, i.e., with phase-only reconfiguration capabilities, and active layers integrated with amplifier chips to enable amplitude control. Our design aims at maximizing the sum rate for the best group of users by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation at the BS and the wave-based beamforming at the SIM. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that using both nearly passive and active layers in the SIM entails a significant enhancement in terms of capacity compared to previously reported phase-only coding SIM.},
